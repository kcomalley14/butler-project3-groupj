Dataset Links: https://www.zillow.com/research/data/

# Steps: 
Download data, and place in SQL database, clean, and connect to it via PowerBI. Copy database to Heroku for sharing.
Create a map that shows prices for single family homes by binning values, and then a slider to show years, and home values.
Create ML in Python for future years and base future pricing from historical price changes and then as you slide or select the years in the future it shows the predicted values.
